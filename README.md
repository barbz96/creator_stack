## Why use it?
* **Early‑signal radar** – catch a sound when it has  < 1 000 uses, not when it’s already saturated.  
* **One‑concept rule** – 5‑15 seed creators post the *same* creative treatment at the same time → algorithm thinks “trend”.  
* **Documented & repeatable** – copy a template, fill in blanks, ship.  
* **Measurable** – included KPI sheet tracks reach, engagement, replication rate.

## Quick start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/creator-stack-playbook.git
cd creator-stack-playbook
open docs/WORKFLOW.md
cp templates/PLAYBOOK_TEMPLATE.md my_first_playbook.md
```
Fill out the template, share with a WhatsApp/Discord group of creators, then track results in `/templates/kpi_sheet.csv`.
