## Mining Insights

Before designing the playbook, we conducted keyword and sound mining using our BI tools:

1. **Detect Usage Acceleration**  
   - Queried the analytics platform (AnyPowerBI2) for sounds/keywords with ≥100 uses in 5 min and ≥3× acceleration versus category median.  
2. **Shortlist Nascent Signals**  
   - Selected sounds that had strong momentum but were not yet viral (<1,000 total uses).  
3. **Review Context**  
   - Analyzed top 20 organic posts for each shortlisted sound to understand format and creator styles.

The playbook below was built for the top-ranked signal identified on 2025‑04‑13.
